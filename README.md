# Blue-Team-Intro-SOC Portfolio Project

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on learning from the Blue Team Introduction module (TryHackMe SOC Level 1).
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical understanding of Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows, including alert triage, investigation methodology, incident response fundamentals, and defensive security operations.

This project is structured as a portfolio showcase highlighting real-world blue team concepts, investigative thinking, and professional documentation practices


## Project Objectives
-Understand real SOC operational workflows
-Practice alert triage and severity prioritization
-Analyze suspicious activity using security telemetry
-Identify and document Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
-Apply structured incident response methodology
-Strengthen defensive detection and investigation mindset


## Skills Demonstrated
-SOC operational workflow comprehension
-Log analysis and evidence correlation
-Incident triage and prioritization techniques
-IOC identification and threat documentation
-Structured investigation methodology
-Defensive security mindset
-Professional security reporting practices

## Scenario Summary
Note: This repository does not include walkthrough answers or flags.

The lab environment simulates a real SOC scenario where suspicious activity must be investigated using log data and security telemetry sources.
The primary focus is on understanding analyst decision-making processes, not simply obtaining lab answers.
Key investigation goals included:
- Identifying abnormal and suspicious behavior
- Correlating events across multiple data sources
- Assessing potential security impact
- Practicing structured investigation workflows

## Investigation Methodology
The investigation process followed a professional SOC workflow:
1. Alert review and initial triage
2. Entity scoping (user, host, timeframe)
3. Evidence correlation and validation
4. IOC identification and documentation
5. Impact assessment
6. Formal documentation and reporting
7. Lessons learned and detection improvement

##Indicators of Compromise (Examples)
During the investigation process, multiple IOC categories were evaluated, including:
- Network indicators (IP addresses, domains)
- Process execution behavior
- Command-line activity patterns
- Authentication anomalies
- File-related artifacts

Sensitive values have been intentionally excluded to ensure this repository remains public-safe.

## Key Lessons Learned
Important takeaways from this project:
- Effective triage significantly reduces investigation time
- Context is critical — not every alert represents a true compromise
- Multi-source correlation improves detection accuracy
- Clear documentation is essential in SOC operations
- Detection logic must balance precision and noise reduction

## Tools and Technologies Used
- TryHackMe SOC Level 1 platform
- Windows event log analysis
- Network telemetry analysis
- SOC investigation methodologies
- Markdown documentation
- Python (basic automation and parsing concepts)
