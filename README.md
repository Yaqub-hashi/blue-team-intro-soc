# Blue Team – Intro to SOC (Blue Team Foundations)

## Overview
This repository documents my learning from the Blue Team Introduction module in the TryHackMe SOC Level 1 learning path. The purpose of this project is to build foundational understanding of how a Security Operations Center (SOC) operates, how alerts are triaged, and how analysts investigate suspicious activity.

The focus of this project is on defensive security fundamentals, analyst decision-making, and developing structured investigation thinking.




## Project Objectives
- Understand basic SOC workflows and analyst responsibilities  
- Practice alert triage and investigation reasoning  
- Identify common Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)  
- Develop a defensive security mindset  



## Skills Demonstrated
- Basic understanding of SOC workflows  
- Introductory alert triage concepts  
- IOC identification fundamentals  
- Investigation reasoning at entry level  
- Defensive security awareness

## Scenario Summary
The lab environment simulates a SOC environment where suspicious activity must be analyzed using security alerts and log-based information. The main focus of the scenario is understanding how analysts think, how investigations are structured, and how security events are evaluated.


## Basic Investigation Workflow
The investigation process followed a professional SOC workflow:
- Alert review and initial triage  
- Identifying affected users or systems  
- Reviewing available evidence  
- Identifying potential IOCs  
- Documenting findings  


## Indicators of Compromise (Examples)
Indicators of Compromise (Examples)

During the investigation, common IOC categories were evaluated, including:

- Suspicious authentication behavior  
- Abnormal process execution patterns  
- Network-related anomalies  

Sensitive values have been excluded to keep this repository public-safe.




## Key Lessons Learned
Important takeaways from this project:
- Effective triage significantly reduces investigation time
- Context is critical — not every alert represents a true compromise
- Multi-source correlation improves detection accuracy
- Clear documentation is essential in SOC operations
- Detection logic must balance precision and noise reduction

## Tools and Technologies Used
- TryHackMe SOC Level 1 platform  
- Basic log interpretation concepts  
- SOC investigation methodologies  
- Markdown documentation
